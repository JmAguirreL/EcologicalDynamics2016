# EcologicalDynamics2016

Final project for Professor Tarik Gouhier's EEMB 5130 Ecological Dynamics 2016 class. The background, goals, and methods of this project are outlined in Project Proposal.txt.

The code in Main.R sets up a two-dimensional lattice, implements rules for updating the lattice at each time step based on the reproduction abilities of the plant species and predatory strength of the predator species, and simulates the population dynamics in the lattice over a specified number of time steps. 

The results for three different predation strengths (a = 0.25, 0.5, 1), each with three different types of reproductive/defensive ability tradeoff (ability_curves.png), are shown in the plota(X).png files.
